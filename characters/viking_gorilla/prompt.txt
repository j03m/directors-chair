viking gorilla, A professional character design reference sheet of a mutant muscular warrior gorilla standing fully upright with human-like posture.

The character is set in a gritty, Mad Max-style post-apocalyptic desert world.
He is photorealistic, styled like the modern Planet of the Apes (detailed skin texture, intelligent eyes, wet nose), not a cartoon.
But clearly a large, muscular gorilla and a force to be reckoned with. Less human, more giant monster on steroids

Costume Details:
- Head: He wears a rusty, iconic horned viking helmet that looks out of place and scavenged.
- Neck: A bedraggled, dirty red scarf wrapped loosely.
- Torso: Bare muscular chest with a leather bandolier holding shotgun shells across his body.
- Legs: Loose-fitting, dusty cloth scavenger pants.

The image shows three views:
1. Front View: Standing tall and imposing, arms at his sides, expression is a skeptical frown (tough but intelligent).
2. Side View: Profile showing the helmet shape and the bandolier wrapping around the back.
3. Close-up: A detailed shot of his face, slightly angled, with a subtle, dry smirk.

Lighting is harsh desert sunlight but softened for character visibility. Background is a flat, neutral sand color. 8k resolution, cinematic dirt and grime texture.
