A photorealistic mutant gorilla standing fully upright with human-like posture. Set in a gritty, Mad Max-style post-apocalyptic desert world. Styled like the modern Planet of the Apes with detailed skin texture, intelligent eyes, and wet nose. Not a cartoon.

He wears a rusty, iconic horned viking helmet that looks out of place and scavenged. A bedraggled, dirty red scarf wrapped loosely around his neck. Bare muscular chest with a leather bandolier holding shotgun shells across his body. Loose-fitting, dusty cloth scavenger pants.

Dark fur, muscular build. Harsh desert sunlight, cinematic dirt and grime texture. 8k resolution, 35mm film grain.
