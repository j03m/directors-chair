A gritty, textured full-body photograph on grainy 35mm film. Standing a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland junkyard under harsh, unforgiving sunlight.

The subject is a a bit rusted and dusty, but a fully articulated robot in the distinct 'Mad Max' or 'Fallout' scavenger style mixed with pathfinder from apex legends.

Its head is a highly modern and expressive-looking computer screen for a head.

The body is a lithe, agile skeletal frame with exposed hydraulic joints, thick cabling, and servos (similar to Pathfinder's silhouette), but constructed from heavy, utilitarian industrial metals rather than sleek armor. It looks designed for heavy labor outdoors with lots of protective railings that appear to be to avoid damage and or move the unit around.

Empty desert background. FUll body shot.
