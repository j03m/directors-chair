raider raider4, A professional character design reference of a menacing post-apocalyptic raider standing upright in an aggressive stance.

Set in a gritty, Mad Max-style post-apocalyptic desert world. Photorealistic, cinematic quality.

Costume Details:
- Head: Terrifying makeshift mask or helmet — welded metal, leather straps, breathing apparatus, goggles, or skull motifs. Face is hidden or mostly hidden. Each raider should look uniquely disturbing.
- Torso: Bare skin showing through torn black leather, metal plates bolted to body armor. Chains, spikes, and sharp metal protruding from shoulders and chest. War paint or scarification visible on exposed skin.
- Arms: Spiked gauntlets, wrapped chains, metal bracers with jagged edges. Heavy and brutal-looking.
- Legs: Heavy black leather pants with knee spikes, metal shin guards. Combat boots wrapped in barbed wire or chain.
- Weapons: A large brutal melee weapon visible — spiked bat, machete, chain with hook, or jagged sword. Held aggressively.

He is terrifying. A nightmare raider from the wasteland. Every surface has spikes or sharp metal. The mask makes him inhuman.

The image shows the full body, standing, facing the camera. Harsh desert sunlight. Background is flat neutral sand. 8k resolution, cinematic.
