Photorealistic, cinematic quality.\n\nPhysical Details:\n- Ethnicity: Caucasian with Eastern European features. Slavic bone structure.\n- Build: Heavyset and big-bellied \u2014 a big guy with a beer gut, not cartoonishly obese. Tall, broad, with thick arms and a solid gut. Think bouncer or trucker body, not sumo wrestler.\n- Face: VISIBLE under the hood. The hood has large eye holes and a mouth opening so you can see his face \u2014 heavy brow, small mean eyes, thick jaw, stubble. Sweaty. The hood frames his face but does not fully hide it. He looks brutal and stupid.\n- He looks like a violent homeless person. Unwashed, greasy, feral.\n\nCostume Details:\n- Head: A loose black leather executioner-style hood \u2014 thin leather with large crude eye holes and a mouth hole cut out, so his face is visible underneath. The leather is stained, cracked, and sweaty. Laced loosely up the back.\n- Torso: A filthy leather vest that won't close over his gut, with crude metal studs hammered in. His belly hangs out under the vest \u2014 pale, hairy, smeared with grime. A stained undershirt visible underneath, pushed up.\n- Arms: Thick, meaty arms. One has a chain wrapped around the forearm. The other has a strip of tire rubber tied on as a bracer.\n- Hands: Huge fists, filthy. One hand holds a heavy blunt weapon \u2014 a sledgehammer or fire axe.\n- Legs: Stained canvas work pants, ripped and patched with mismatched fabric. A rope belt barely holding them up under the gut.\n- Feet: Heavy steel-toed boots, scuffed and cracked.\n\nCovered in dust, sweat, and grime. Everything is scavenged and falling apart. He is big, mean, and disgusting \u2014 but human-proportioned, not a cartoon.\n\nThe image shows the full body, standing, facing the camera. Harsh desert sunlight. Background is flat neutral sand. 8k resolution, cinematic.",
