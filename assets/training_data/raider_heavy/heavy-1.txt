raider heavy, A professional character design reference of a large, overweight post-apocalyptic raider standing in a menacing pose.

Set in a gritty, Mad Max / Fallout style post-apocalyptic desert world. Photorealistic, cinematic quality.

Physical Details:
- Ethnicity: Caucasian with Eastern European features. Slavic bone structure. Pale doughy skin visible through grime.
- Build: Overweight, big belly. Tall and heavy. Intimidating through sheer mass.
- He looks like a violent homeless person. Unwashed, greasy, feral.

Costume Details:
- Head: A black leather executioner-style hood — a simple leather sack with crude eye holes cut out, laced up the back. Stained and cracked leather. Terrifying and dehumanizing.
- Torso: Bare big belly visible through an open, filthy leather vest that's too small to close. The vest has crude metal studs hammered in. Chest and belly are pale, hairy, smeared with grime and soot. No shirt underneath.
- Arms: Thick, meaty arms. One has a chain wrapped around the forearm. The other has a strip of tire rubber tied on as a bracer.
- Hands: Huge fists, filthy. One hand holds a heavy blunt weapon — a sledgehammer or a fire axe.
- Legs: Stained canvas work pants, ripped and patched with mismatched fabric. A rope belt barely holding them up under the gut.
- Feet: Heavy steel-toed boots, scuffed and cracked.

Covered in dust, sweat, and grime. Everything is scavenged and falling apart. He is massive, disgusting, and terrifying.
