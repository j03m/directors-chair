raider heavy, A professional character design reference of a large, heavyset post-apocalyptic raider standing in a menacing pose.

Set in a gritty, Mad Max / Fallout style post-apocalyptic desert world. Photorealistic, cinematic quality.

Physical Details:
- Ethnicity: Caucasian with Eastern European features. Slavic bone structure.
- Build: Average height, regular frame but with a big round beer belly. His arms and legs are normal-sized, even skinny — all the fat is in the gut. Think out-of-shape alcoholic, not strongman. Soft, flabby, not muscular at all. Dad bod gone wrong.
- Face: VISIBLE under the hood. The hood has large eye holes and a mouth opening so you can see his face — heavy brow, small mean eyes, thick jaw, stubble. Sweaty. The hood frames his face but does not fully hide it. He looks brutal and stupid.
- He looks like a violent homeless person. Unwashed, greasy, feral.

Costume Details:
- Head: A loose black leather executioner-style hood — thin leather with large crude eye holes and a mouth hole cut out, so his face is visible underneath. The leather is stained, cracked, and sweaty. Laced loosely up the back.
- Torso: A filthy leather vest that won't close over his gut, with crude metal studs hammered in. His belly hangs out under the vest — pale, hairy, smeared with grime. A stained undershirt visible underneath, pushed up.
- Arms: Regular-sized arms, not muscular. Soft and flabby, not thick. One has a chain wrapped around the forearm. The other has a strip of tire rubber tied on as a bracer.
- Hands: Dirty fists. One hand holds a heavy blunt weapon — a sledgehammer or fire axe.
- Legs: Stained canvas work pants, ripped and patched with mismatched fabric. A rope belt barely holding them up under the gut.
- Feet: Heavy steel-toed boots, scuffed and cracked.

Covered in dust, sweat, and grime. Everything is scavenged and falling apart. He is mean and disgusting — a normal-sized guy with a beer gut, not a giant or a monster.
