raider goggles, A professional character design reference of a menacing post-apocalyptic raider standing in an aggressive stance.

Set in a gritty, Mad Max / Fallout style post-apocalyptic desert world. Photorealistic, cinematic quality.

Physical Details:
- Ethnicity: Caucasian with Eastern European features. Slavic bone structure. Shaved head or buzz cut.
- Face: Angular, mean. A scar across one cheek. Clenched jaw. The goggles hide his eyes, making him look insectoid and inhuman.
- Build: Athletic, lean and mean. Wiry muscle.
- He looks like a violent homeless person. Filthy, sunburned, feral.

Costume Details:
- Head: Oversized vintage motorcycle goggles with tinted lenses, strapped tight over his eyes. The rubber seal is cracked and yellowed. A dirty bandana tied over his nose and mouth underneath.
- Torso: Spiked armor — a repurposed leather motorcycle jacket with metal spikes bolted through the shoulders and collar. Nails and screws driven through from the inside. The leather is cracked and sun-bleached. Under it, a filthy grey t-shirt.
- Arms: Metal bracers made from flattened cans and scrap, wired to his forearms. Spikes welded to the knuckle area of his gloves.
- Hands: Heavy leather motorcycle gloves with screws through the knuckles.
- Legs: Black cargo pants, torn and patched. Metal shin guards made from car door panels strapped with wire.
- Feet: Motorcycle boots with spurs made from bent nails.
- Weapon: A machete or large serrated knife, blade nicked and dull.

Covered in dust and grime. Everything is junk repurposed as armor. The spikes are crude — bent nails, screws, and bolts. Scary but clearly destitute.
