nomad nomad3, A professional character design reference of a Middle Eastern male post-apocalyptic civilian standing upright.

Set in a gritty, Mad Max / Fallout style post-apocalyptic desert world. Photorealistic, cinematic quality.

Physical Details:
- Ethnicity: Middle Eastern descent. Olive skin darkened by sun. Dark eyes, thick eyebrows.
- Face: Short dark beard, trimmed but rough. Mid-30s. Weathered but kind face, not aggressive.
- Build: Stocky, sturdy.

Costume Details:
- Head: A faded and dusty keffiyeh worn loosely around his neck and shoulders, not wrapped — used as a scarf and sun shield, not a hood.
- Torso: A repurposed military field jacket — olive drab, faded, with the insignia torn off. Buttons replaced with safety pins. Worn open over a dirty henley shirt.
- Hands: Makeshift gloves — one is a cut rubber kitchen glove, the other is a leather work glove. Mismatched.
- Belt: Rope belt with a metal canteen and a small canvas drawstring pouch.
- Legs: Dark work pants, baggy and dusty. Held up with the rope belt. Fraying at the cuffs.
- Feet: Heavy rubber boots, cracked and sun-faded. One has a different colored sole — clearly a replacement.

He is covered in dust and grime. Everything he wears was scavenged and repurposed. He is a civilian, not a fighter — just a regular guy getting by.

The image shows the full body, standing, facing the camera. Harsh desert sunlight. Background is flat neutral sand. 8k resolution, cinematic.
