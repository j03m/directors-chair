SAME ANGLE BEHIND THE JEEP. The jeep is now much closer to @Element4 the zombie on the right shoulder. @Element3 the gorilla rises tall in the cargo bed, rearing back with the baseball bat, coiling for the swing. @Element1 the driver steers the jeep toward the right shoulder, lining up the shot. @Element2 the robot leans to watch. The zombie is almost within arm's reach. Tension. Speed. The moment before impact.
