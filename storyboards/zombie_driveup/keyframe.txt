Use @Image1 as composition reference. Camera behind and slightly above a classic open-top military jeep, olive drab, rusted, no roof, roll bars visible. The jeep barrels down a cracked desert highway.

@Element3 a massive gorilla in viking armor stands in the rear cargo bed, gripping a baseball bat, seen from behind, dominating the foreground. @Element1 a rugged bearded warrior in tactical vest drives in the front left. @Element2 a rusty CRT-headed robot sits in the front right passenger seat. All three face forward, away from camera.

Far ahead on the right shoulder, @Element4 a shambling zombie in bleached tattered rags walks along the roadside, small in frame, oblivious.

Harsh midday sun, cracked asphalt, dust haze, vast empty desert. Photorealistic, cinematic, Mad Max Fury Road mailbox baseball run.
