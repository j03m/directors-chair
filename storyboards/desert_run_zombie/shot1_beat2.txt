PUSH IN TO CLOSE-UP. @Element1 the zombie slowly turns its head toward the camera. Its face is revealed — grey rotting flesh, jaw hanging slightly open, patches of exposed skull bone. Its eyes are completely cloudy white, no iris, no pupil, just milky dead orbs. It stares blankly at the camera. Cinematic horror close-up.
