A static, locked-off Medium Full Shot in 2.39:1 aspect ratio on grainy 35mm film.

@viking-gorilla sits in a low-slung sand chair in a desolate desert wasteland. He is dressed in a rusty horned viking helmet, a bedraggled dirty red scarf, a leather bandolier across his bare muscular chest, and dusty scavenger pants.

The action is heavy and slow: @viking-gorilla tips the helmet back from his eyes, then grips the chair’s armrests. He lumbers heavily upward into a standing position. Once standing, he stretches his arms high above his head and lets out a massive, toothy yawn.

Golden hour lighting matches the previous scene. The background is a soft-focus rusted truck and heat haze.
