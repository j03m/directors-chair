Change the scene to a cinematic wide shot from behind, low angle. The gorilla walks away from camera across flat scorched desert with a heavy deliberate stride. Dust kicks up with each step. Vast empty desert stretches ahead to a hazy horizon. The rusted truck and a beach chair are small in the background. Keep the exact same gorilla character with viking helmet, red scarf, bandolier. Harsh noon sunlight, long shadows cast forward, 35mm film grain, anamorphic lens.
