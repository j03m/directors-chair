A slow, steady tracking shot from directly behind in 2.39:1 aspect ratio on grainy 35mm film.

@viking-gorilla walks rhythmically and steadily away from the camera across the flat desert floor, moving toward the horizon. From behind, we see the back of his rusty viking helmet, the knot of the dirty red scarf, the strap of the leather bandolier crossing his broad back, and his dusty scavenger pants.

The camera follows behind him at a uniform distance. As he advances, the flat desert ground ahead abruptly terminates into a sharp, sheer cliff edge, instantly revealing a massive, vacant expanse of open sky and distant atmospheric haze beyond the drop.

Golden hour lighting casts long shadows forward ahead of him.
