A static, locked-off Close-Up shot in 2.39:1 aspect ratio on grainy 35mm film.

@viking-gorilla stands motionless at the sheer cliff edge. The low golden hour sun hits the side of his face, highlighting every texture. A strong wind whips his dirty red scarf violently and ruffles his facial fur. He wears the rusty horned viking helmet, tipped slightly back.

He deliberately places a thick cigar into the corner of his mouth, strikes a match, and cups his hands to light it against the wind. Thick, blue-grey cigar smoke curls luxuriously from his mouth and is immediately caught by the wind, drifting sideways across the frame.

His expression is thoughtful and melancholic as he stares fixedly out past the camera into the far distance, eyes slightly narrowed against the wind and sun.
