A slow, steady tracking shot from directly behind in 2.39:1 aspect ratio on grainy 35mm film.

@viking-gorilla walks rhythmically away from camera across the flat desert floor. A tall rusty robot with a TV screen for a head follows a few steps behind, walking with a stiff mechanical gait, struggling to keep pace.

Both figures move toward the horizon. The flat desert ground ahead terminates into a sharp cliff edge, revealing vast open sky and distant haze beyond the drop.

Golden hour lighting casts long shadows forward.
