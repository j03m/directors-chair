Place both characters into a single scene. Cinematic tight close-up, rear 3/4 profile at a cliff edge. The gorilla on the left and the robot on the right stand side by side at the edge, looking out over a vast landscape below. Strong wind whips the gorilla's red scarf, ruffles his fur, and sways the robot's loose wiring. Harsh high-contrast sunlight creates strong rim-lighting against vast clear sky. 35mm film grain.
