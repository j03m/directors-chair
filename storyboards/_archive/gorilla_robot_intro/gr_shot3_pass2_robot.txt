Add a tall, weathered junkyard robot standing beside the gorilla at the cliff edge, slightly behind him. The robot has a boxy vintage CRT television monitor for a head with a cracked dark screen, a skeletal mechanical body made of rusted metal, exposed wiring and hydraulic pistons. Wind sways its loose wiring. Both figures look out over the vast landscape. Keep the gorilla and all scene details exactly as they are. Do not change the gorilla in any way.
