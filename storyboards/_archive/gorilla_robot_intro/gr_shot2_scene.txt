Place both characters into a single scene. Cinematic wide shot from behind, low angle. The gorilla on the left walks away from camera across flat scorched desert with a heavy deliberate stride. The robot on the right walks a few steps behind, struggling to keep pace with a stiff mechanical gait. Dust kicks up with each step. Vast empty desert stretches ahead to a hazy horizon. Harsh noon sunlight, long shadows cast forward, 35mm film grain, anamorphic lens.
