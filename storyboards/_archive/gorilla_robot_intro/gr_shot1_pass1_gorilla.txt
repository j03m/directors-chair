Change the scene so the gorilla is slumped in a low beach chair facing left, legs splayed, napping with his viking helmet tipped over his eyes, fingers interlocked over his belly. Place him in a vast scorched desolate desert. Add a hulking rusted-out 1950s pickup truck on stripped axles with no wheels right next to him. Heavy wind blowing sand horizontally, harsh noon sunlight, heat shimmer. Keep the exact same gorilla character with viking helmet, red scarf, bandolier. Cinematic low-angle side-profile shot, 35mm film grain, anamorphic lens.
