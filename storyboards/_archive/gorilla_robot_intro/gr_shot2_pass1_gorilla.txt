Change the scene to a cinematic wide shot from the front, low angle. The gorilla walks along the camera across flat scorched desert with a heavy deliberate stride. Dust kicks up with each step. Vast empty desert stretches ahead to a hazy horizon. Keep the exact same gorilla character with viking helmet, red scarf, bandolier. Harsh noon sunlight, long shadows cast forward, 35mm film grain, anamorphic lens.
