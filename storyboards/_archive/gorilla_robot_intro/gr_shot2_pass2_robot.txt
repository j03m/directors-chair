Add a tall, weathered junkyard robot walking a few steps behind and to the right of the gorilla. The robot has a boxy vintage CRT television monitor for a head with a cracked dark screen, a skeletal mechanical body made of rusted metal, exposed wiring and hydraulic pistons, and long thin mechanical legs. It walks with a stiff, slightly lurching mechanical gait, struggling to keep pace. Keep the gorilla and all desert scene details exactly as they are. Do not change the gorilla in any way.
