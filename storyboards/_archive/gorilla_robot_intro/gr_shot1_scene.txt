Place both characters into a single scene. The gorilla on the left is slumped in a low beach chair facing left, legs splayed, napping with his viking helmet tipped over his eyes, fingers interlocked over his belly. The robot on the right stands nearby, slightly hunched, keeping still vigil over the sleeping gorilla. Set in a vast scorched desolate desert with a hulking rusted-out 1950s pickup truck on stripped axles. Heavy wind blowing sand, harsh noon sunlight, heat shimmer. Cinematic low-angle side-profile shot, 35mm film grain, anamorphic lens.
