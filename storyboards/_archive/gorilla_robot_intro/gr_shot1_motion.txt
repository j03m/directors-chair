A static, locked-off Medium Full Shot in 2.39:1 aspect ratio on grainy 35mm film.

@viking-gorilla sits in a low-slung sand chair in a desolate desert wasteland. A tall rusty robot with a TV screen for a head stands nearby, keeping still vigil.

The gorilla tips the helmet back from his eyes, grips the armrests, and lumbers heavily upward into a standing position. He stretches his arms high and lets out a massive yawn. The robot tilts its TV-head slightly, watching him.

Golden hour lighting. The background is a soft-focus rusted truck and heat haze.
