Add a tall, weathered junkyard robot standing near the beach chair, as if keeping watch over the sleeping gorilla. The robot has a boxy vintage CRT television monitor for a head with a cracked dark screen, a skeletal mechanical body made of rusted metal, exposed wiring and hydraulic pistons, and long thin mechanical legs. It stands slightly hunched, arms hanging loose at its sides. Keep the gorilla, beach chair, truck, and all desert scene details exactly as they are. Do not change the gorilla in any way.
