A static, locked-off Close-Up shot in 2.39:1 aspect ratio on grainy 35mm film.

@viking-gorilla and the rusty TV-headed robot stand side by side at the sheer cliff edge. Wind whips the gorilla's red scarf and ruffles his fur. The robot's loose wiring sways in the gusts.

The gorilla places a cigar in his mouth and lights it. Thick smoke curls and drifts sideways in the wind. Both figures stare out past the camera into the distance. The robot's cracked screen flickers faintly.
