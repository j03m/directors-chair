Use @Image1 as composition reference. Medium close-up, front-facing camera.

@Element1 a rugged bearded warrior in tactical vest sits in a faded hot-pink folding beach chair with white hibiscus print. He looks off to the side with slacker annoyance — not angry, just bothered. Eyebrows raised, mouth slightly open like he's saying "seriously?" One hand gestures lazily in protest. Frustrated but too lazy to do anything about it.

Desert background, golden hour light. Photorealistic, cinematic.
