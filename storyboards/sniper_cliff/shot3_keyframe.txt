Use @Image1 as composition reference. Low angle, ground level, cinematic.

@Element1 a massive gorilla in viking armor and horned helmet lies prone at the edge of a desert cliff, looking down over the edge through the scope of a large sniper rifle. The rifle is long and heavy, resting on a bipod. The gorilla is completely focused, one eye to the scope, perfectly still. His horned helmet glints in the light.

Rocky cliff edge, vast desert landscape visible far below. Golden hour, warm light. Photorealistic, cinematic. Serious sniper energy — total contrast to the lazy beach chair vibe.
