Camera positioned directly behind and slightly above a military jeep, looking forward down a straight desert highway. The jeep fills the bottom half of frame, centered. We see the back of the jeep: a large figure (gorilla) standing tall in the rear cargo bed, center frame, holding a bat. A regular_male figure (robot) visible in the front right passenger seat. A driver in the front left seat. The highway stretches ahead to a vanishing point. Very far down the road, near the vanishing point on the RIGHT shoulder, a tiny regular_male figure (zombie) walks. The zombie is extremely small and distant — at least 200 meters ahead. Camera lens ~35mm, the road and vanishing point dominate the upper half of frame.
