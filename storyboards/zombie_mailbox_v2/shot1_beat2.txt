Camera dollies steadily behind the military jeep as it speeds down the desert highway. The jeep pulls alongside @Element2 the zombie on the right shoulder. @Element1 the gorilla in the cargo bed swings the baseball bat in a powerful lateral arc, connecting with the zombie as the jeep passes. The zombie falls to the road. The jeep continues forward, never slowing. Camera tracks smoothly behind the vehicle throughout. Dust trail, harsh sun, desert highway.
