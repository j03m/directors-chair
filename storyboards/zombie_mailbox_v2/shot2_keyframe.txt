Use @Image1 as composition reference. LOW ANGLE ground-level camera on cracked desert asphalt. @Element2 the zombie lies fallen and motionless face-down on the road, crumpled body in tattered rags sprawled on the blacktop. Beyond the body, a military jeep drives away down the long straight highway, trailing dust. The road stretches to the vanishing point under brutal midday sun. Empty wasteland. Photorealistic, cinematic, handheld documentary feel, bleak aftermath.
