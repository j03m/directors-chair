Use @Image1 as composition reference. Camera directly behind and slightly above a classic open-top military jeep, olive drab, rusted, roll bars visible. The jeep fills the bottom half of frame, centered on the road, facing away from camera.

@Element1 a massive gorilla in viking armor stands tall in the rear cargo bed, back to camera, center of frame, gripping a baseball bat. A rugged bearded warrior drives in the front left. @Element2 a rusty CRT-headed robot sits in the front right passenger seat. Everyone faces forward, away from camera.

The desert highway stretches ahead to a distant vanishing point. Very far down the road on the right shoulder, barely visible, @Element3 a shambling zombie in tattered rags — tiny, distant, at least 200 meters ahead. The zombie is a small speck on the road, not close.

Harsh midday sun, cracked asphalt stretching to the horizon, dust haze, vast empty desert. Photorealistic, cinematic, Mad Max Fury Road.
