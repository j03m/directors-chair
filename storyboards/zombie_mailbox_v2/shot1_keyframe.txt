Use @Image1 as composition reference. HANDHELD CAMERA behind a classic open-top military jeep, olive drab, rusted, roll bars. The jeep barrels down a cracked desert highway. @Element1 a massive gorilla in viking armor stands in the rear cargo bed gripping a baseball bat, seen from behind. Two figures in the front seats face forward. Far ahead on the right shoulder, @Element2 a shambling zombie in tattered rags walks along the roadside, small in frame. Harsh midday sun, dust, vast empty desert. Photorealistic, cinematic, handheld documentary feel, Mad Max Fury Road.
