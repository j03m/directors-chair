LOW ANGLE GROUND SHOT. Handheld camera on the hot desert road. @Element2 the zombie's body lies crumpled and motionless face-down on the asphalt, tattered rags. Beyond it, the military jeep drives away down the long straight highway, trailing dust, shrinking into the distance. Harsh sun. Heat shimmer rises off the road. Total stillness. The jeep vanishes toward the horizon. Desolation.
