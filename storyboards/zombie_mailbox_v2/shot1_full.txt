The military jeep barrels down the desert highway toward @Element3 the zombie standing on the roadside. @Element1 the gorilla in the rear cargo bed raises the baseball bat. The jeep roars past the zombie — the gorilla swings hard, the bat connects with a spray of blood. The jeep accelerates away down the straight road, shrinking into the distance, dust trail billowing behind it. Camera stays behind the jeep as it speeds toward the vanishing point. Fast continuous forward motion throughout.
