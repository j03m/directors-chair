A military jeep already speeding down a desert highway approaches @Element3 the zombie standing at the roadside. @Element1 the gorilla stands in the rear cargo bed gripping a baseball bat. As the jeep passes the zombie the gorilla swings the bat sideways and the bat strikes the zombie square in the head, knocking it clean off. The headless body crumples. The jeep continues speeding away down the road into the distance. Camera tracks behind the jeep throughout. Continuous fast motion, no stopping.
