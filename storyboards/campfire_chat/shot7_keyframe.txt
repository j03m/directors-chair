Use @Image1 as composition reference. Low angle camera, same two-shot framing as before.

@Element1 a rugged bearded warrior in tactical vest sits in a cheap low-profile folding beach chair — the chair is faded hot-pink canvas with white tropical hibiscus flower print, aluminum frame, dirty and sand-caked but still absurdly cheerful. He sits on the left. @Element2 a massive gorilla in viking armor sits in a cheap low-profile folding beach chair — the chair is faded lime-green canvas with white tropical palm tree print, aluminum frame, dirty and sand-caked but still absurdly cheerful. He sits on the right. Both look at each other. The warrior shakes his head side to side with a dismissive expression, like saying "no way." The gorilla watches him. Brown whiskey bottle rests between them. Desert ground, hazy sky. Warm golden hour light. Photorealistic, cinematic. The ridiculous tropical beach chairs are caked in dust but their faded colors still pop against the bleak desert.
