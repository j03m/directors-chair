Use @Image1 as composition reference. Low angle camera, same two-shot framing as before.

@Element1 a rugged bearded warrior in tactical vest sits in a bright neon-pink beach chair on the left. @Element2 a massive gorilla in viking armor sits in a bright lime-green beach chair on the right. Both look at each other. The warrior shakes his head side to side with a dismissive expression, like saying "no way." The gorilla watches him. Brown whiskey bottle rests between them. Desert ground, hazy sky. Warm golden hour light. Photorealistic, cinematic.
