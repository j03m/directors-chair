Use @Image1 as composition reference. Front-facing camera, low angle, same two-shot framing as the opening — camera returns to the front.

@Element1 a rugged bearded warrior in tactical vest slouches in a cheap low-profile folding beach chair — the chair is faded hot-pink canvas with white tropical hibiscus flower print, aluminum frame, dirty and sand-caked but still absurdly cheerful. He sits on the left. @Element2 a massive gorilla in full viking armor and horned helmet sprawls in a cheap low-profile folding beach chair — the chair is faded lime-green canvas with white tropical palm tree print, aluminum frame, dirty and sand-caked but still absurdly cheerful. He sits on the right. Both look at each other with lazy amusement. The warrior shakes his head dismissively, like saying "no way." The gorilla watches him, unbothered.

@Element3 a rusty CRT-headed robot stands just behind and between the two chairs, slightly back, having just walked up. The robot's glowing blue screen faces the camera.

Brown whiskey bottle rests between the chairs. Desert ground, hazy sky. Warm golden hour light. Photorealistic, cinematic. Slacker energy — two bums and a robot at the end of the world.
