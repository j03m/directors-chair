Use @Image1 as composition reference. Camera behind the two seated figures, looking over their shoulders.

@Element1 a rugged bearded warrior slouches in a cheap low-profile folding beach chair — faded hot-pink canvas with white tropical hibiscus flower print, dirty and sand-caked. @Element2 a massive gorilla in full viking armor and horned helmet sprawls in a cheap low-profile folding beach chair — faded lime-green canvas with white tropical palm tree print, dirty and sand-caked. The gorilla's horned helmet and armored shoulders are clearly visible from behind. Both have their backs to camera, left and right of frame, slumped like lazy bums. In front of them, @Element3 a rusty robot with a glowing blue CRT television screen head walks toward them from the desert, facing the camera. The robot stands upright, arms slightly raised in a shrug. The robot's CRT screen displays a simple picture of a handgun. Desert wasteland stretches behind the robot. Golden hour light. Photorealistic, cinematic.
