Use @Image1 as composition reference. Camera behind the two seated figures, looking over their shoulders.

@Element1 a rugged bearded warrior sits in a cheap low-profile folding beach chair — faded hot-pink canvas with white tropical hibiscus flower print, dirty and sand-caked. @Element2 a massive gorilla in viking armor sits in a cheap low-profile folding beach chair — faded lime-green canvas with white tropical palm tree print, dirty and sand-caked. Both have their backs to camera, left and right of frame. In front of them, @Element3 a rusty robot with a glowing blue CRT television screen head walks toward them from the desert, facing the camera. The robot stands upright, arms slightly raised in a shrug. The robot's CRT screen displays a simple picture of a handgun. Desert wasteland stretches behind the robot. Golden hour light. Photorealistic, cinematic.
