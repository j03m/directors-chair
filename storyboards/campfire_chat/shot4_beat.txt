The gorilla extends the brown whiskey bottle outward to his side, glancing at the label. He stays slumped, barely moving, but there's a subtle smirk on his face — amused by something that was just said.

The gorilla with tone reminiscent of the movie Ted, clearly amused:

He shrugs and takes another drink. Warm light on his viking armor and horned helmet. Quiet moment between friends.
