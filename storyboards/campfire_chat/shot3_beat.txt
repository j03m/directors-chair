The bearded warrior slouches in the beach chair, talking with lazy confidence. He gestures loosely with one hand, half-smirking, delivering a line like it's the funniest thing he's ever said but playing it totally deadpan.

The warrior says with tone reminiscent of the movie Ted:
<<<cranial>>> Your mom invented low-cost laser hair removal.

Looks slightly off-camera to the right. Quiet self-amusement, like he's trying not to crack up at his own joke. Slumped in the faded pink chair, totally relaxed.
