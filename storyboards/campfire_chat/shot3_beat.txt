@Element1 the bearded warrior slouches in the beach chair, talking lazily. He gestures half-heartedly with one hand while speaking, looks slightly off-camera to the right with an overconfident smirk. Like he's telling a story he's told a hundred times and doesn't care if anyone's listening. Slumped posture in the faded pink chair.
