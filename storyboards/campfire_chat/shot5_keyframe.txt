Use @Image1 as composition reference. Low angle camera, slightly below eye level, about 6 feet away. Same framing as opening shot.

@Element1 a rugged bearded warrior in tactical vest slouches in a cheap low-profile folding beach chair — the chair is faded hot-pink canvas with white tropical hibiscus flower print, aluminum frame, dirty and sand-caked but still absurdly cheerful. He sits on the left, leaning lazily toward the gorilla to take the brown whiskey bottle. @Element2 a massive gorilla in viking armor and horned helmet sprawls in a cheap low-profile folding beach chair — the chair is faded lime-green canvas with white tropical palm tree print, aluminum frame, dirty and sand-caked but still absurdly cheerful. He sits on the right, arm extended, passing the bottle with zero effort. Both look like lazy slackers who couldn't care less about the apocalypse. Flat cracked desert ground, hazy sky. Warm golden hour light. Photorealistic, cinematic. The ridiculous tropical beach chairs are caked in dust but their faded colors still pop against the bleak desert.
