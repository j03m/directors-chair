Use @Image1 as composition reference. Medium close-up, waist up.

@Element1 a rugged bearded warrior in tactical vest and desert combat pants sits in a cheap low-profile folding beach chair — the chair is faded hot-pink canvas with white tropical hibiscus flower print, aluminum frame, dirty and sand-caked but still absurdly cheerful. He is slightly right of center. He gestures casually with one hand while talking, relaxed posture. Desert background soft and out of focus behind him. Warm golden hour light. Photorealistic, cinematic, shallow depth of field.
