Use @Image1 as composition reference. Medium close-up, waist up. Only one character in frame sitting in one single beach chair.

@Element1 a rugged bearded warrior in tactical vest and desert combat pants slouches in a single cheap low-profile folding beach chair — the chair is faded hot-pink canvas with white tropical hibiscus flower print, aluminum frame, dirty and sand-caked but still absurdly cheerful. Only this one chair is visible in the frame. He is slightly right of center. He gestures lazily with one hand while talking, slumped posture, overconfident smirk like nothing in this wasteland can touch him. Desert background soft and out of focus behind him. Warm golden hour light. Photorealistic, cinematic, shallow depth of field.
