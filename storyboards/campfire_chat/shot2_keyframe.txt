Use @Image1 as composition reference. Medium close-up, waist up.

@Element1 an enormous 7-foot-tall 400-pound gorilla in viking armor and horned helmet slouches in a cheap low-profile folding beach chair — the chair is faded lime-green canvas with white tropical palm tree print, aluminum frame, dirty and sand-caked but still absurdly cheerful. He is slightly left of center. He holds a brown glass whiskey bottle loosely in one massive hand, dangling it lazily. Half-lidded eyes, bored expression, totally checked out like a slacker on break. Desert background soft and out of focus behind him. Warm golden hour light. Photorealistic, cinematic, shallow depth of field.
