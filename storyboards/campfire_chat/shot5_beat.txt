The bearded warrior reaches over and takes the brown whiskey bottle from the gorilla. He takes a slow sip, smirks, hands it back.

The warrior says matter of factly:
<<<cranial>>> Fair enough.

The gorilla shakes his head slightly — a quiet "you're an idiot" headshake but with affection. They settle into their colorful beach chairs, both quietly smirking at nothing in particular. Easy companionable silence between two friends who don't need to fill it. Warm golden light, dust drifting.
