Camera behind @Element1 the warrior and @Element2 the gorilla in their beach chairs. @Element3 the rusty CRT-headed robot walks up from the desert toward them. The robot stops, looks at both of them, and shrugs with both arms raised. A picture of a handgun appears on his glowing blue CRT screen. The warrior and gorilla are seen from behind, their heads turning slightly to look at the robot.
