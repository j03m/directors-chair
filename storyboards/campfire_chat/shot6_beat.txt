Camera behindthe warrior andthe gorilla slouched in their beach chairs. The rusty CRT-headed robot walks up from the desert toward them. The robot stops in front of them and shrugs with both arms raised. A picture of a handgun appears on his glowing blue CRT screen.

The robot says in uncannily positive and excited, yet still digital tone:
<<<robot>>> It seems some people on the road are being assaulted! Looks fun! We should help them!

The warrior and gorilla barely react — their heads turn slightly to look at the robot, then glance at each other with deadpan amusement. Like this is completely normal.
