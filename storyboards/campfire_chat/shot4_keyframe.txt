Use @Image1 as composition reference. Medium close-up, waist up.

@Element1 a massive gorilla in viking armor and horned helmet sits in a cheap low-profile folding beach chair — the chair is faded lime-green canvas with white tropical palm tree print, aluminum frame, dirty and sand-caked but still absurdly cheerful. He is slightly left of center. He takes a swig from a brown glass whiskey bottle, head tilted back slightly. Desert background soft and out of focus. Warm golden hour light. Photorealistic, cinematic, shallow depth of field.
