Use @Image1 as composition reference. Medium close-up, waist up.

@Element1 an enormous 7-foot-tall 400-pound gorilla in viking armor and horned helmet slouches in a cheap low-profile folding beach chair — the chair is faded lime-green canvas with white tropical palm tree print, aluminum frame, dirty and sand-caked but still absurdly cheerful. He is slightly left of center. He casually extends the brown glass whiskey bottle outward with one hand, lazily offering it to someone off-camera without turning his body. His body stays slumped and facing the camera, barely moving, just his arm reaching out to the side. Bored, heavy-lidded expression, total slacker energy. Desert background soft and out of focus. Warm golden hour light. Photorealistic, cinematic, shallow depth of field.
