The gorilla slouches in the beach chair, looking slightly off-camera to the left with a deadpan expression. One corner of his mouth curls up in a barely-there smirk, like he just heard something stupid and is quietly amused.

He holds the whiskey bottle loosely, gives a slow dismissive nod. Mildly entertained, not trying to show it. Subtle breathing, slight head tilt.

The gorilla retorts with a deadpan joke, sitting back in his chair with tone reminiscent of the movie Ted:
<<<gorilla>>> Your mom could masterfully apply the camel clutch.
