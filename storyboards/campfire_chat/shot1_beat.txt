The gorilla takes a slow pull from the whiskey bottle, side-eyes the bearded warrior with a deadpan smirk, passes the bottle over.

The warrior takes it, smirks back, swigs then says as a deadpan joke, leaning back in his chair casually, using little energy with tone reminiscent of the movie Ted:
<<<cranial>>> Your mom has a bicep tattoo that says “She Comes First”

He takes a swig of the whiskey and smirks. The gorilla smirks in response.

They slouch in colorful beach chairs trading the bottle. Subtle amusement — slight head shakes, knowing glances, old friends giving each other shit. No big reactions, just quiet smirks and deadpan expressions. Desert wind stirs dust. Warm golden light.
