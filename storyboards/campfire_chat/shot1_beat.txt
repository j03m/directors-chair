@Element2 the gorilla lazily takes a long swig from the brown whiskey bottle, then passes it over to @Element1 the bearded warrior without looking. The warrior takes the bottle, raises it sluggishly, and drinks. They slouch in their colorful beach chairs like two bums without a care in the world. Lazy idle movements — shifting weight, scratching, yawning. The desert wind stirs dust around them. Warm light. Slow, slacker pacing.
