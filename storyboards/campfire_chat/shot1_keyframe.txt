Use @Image1 as composition reference. Low angle camera, slightly below eye level, about 6 feet away.

@Element1 a rugged bearded warrior in tactical vest and desert combat pants sits in a comically bright neon-pink low-profile beach chair on the left side of frame. @Element2 a massive gorilla in viking armor and horned helmet sits in a comically bright lime-green low-profile beach chair on the right side of frame. The beach chairs are absurdly colorful against the dusty apocalyptic setting.

They sit close together, relaxed. The gorilla holds a brown glass whiskey bottle. Flat cracked desert ground, hazy sky, distant mountains. Photorealistic, cinematic, warm golden hour light. The colorful chairs pop against the muted post-apocalyptic landscape.
