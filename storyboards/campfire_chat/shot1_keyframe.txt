@Element1 a rugged bearded warrior in tactical vest and desert combat pants slouches lazily in a cheap low-profile folding beach chair — the chair is faded hot-pink canvas with white tropical hibiscus flower print, aluminum frame, dirty and sand-caked but still absurdly cheerful. He sits on the left side of frame, legs stretched out, totally unbothered. @Element2 a massive gorilla in viking armor and horned helmet sprawls in a cheap low-profile folding beach chair — the chair is faded lime-green canvas with white tropical palm tree print, aluminum frame, dirty and sand-caked but still absurdly cheerful. He sits on the right side of frame, slumped back like he owns the apocalypse.

They sit close together, lazy and bored, like two slackers on a beach vacation at the end of the world. The gorilla holds a brown glass whiskey bottle loosely. Flat cracked desert ground, hazy sky, distant mountains. Photorealistic, cinematic, warm golden hour light. The ridiculous tropical beach chairs are caked in dust and grime but their faded colors still pop against the bleak post-apocalyptic desert.
