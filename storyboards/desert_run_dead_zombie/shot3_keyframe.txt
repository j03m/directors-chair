Use @Image1 as composition reference. Ground-level camera shot on cracked desert asphalt. In the near foreground, @Element4 the zombie lies crumpled and headless on the road, tattered rags splayed out, dark gore pooling on the hot asphalt. Beyond the body, a classic open-top military jeep drives away down the desert highway into the distance, trailing dust. The road stretches to the vanishing point under the harsh midday sun. Desolate. Empty. The jeep gets smaller. Photorealistic, cinematic, Cormac McCarthy, bleak aftermath.
