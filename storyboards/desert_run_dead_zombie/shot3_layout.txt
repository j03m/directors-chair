Camera on the ground level, very low angle. In the foreground, a regular_male figure (zombie) lies crumpled and headless on the cracked desert road. Beyond the body, a military jeep shape drives away down the highway into the distance, getting smaller. The road stretches to the vanishing point. Camera lens ~24mm wide angle, ground level looking past the fallen body toward the departing jeep.
