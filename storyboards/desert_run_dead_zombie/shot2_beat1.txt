OVER-THE-SHOULDER from behind @Element3 the gorilla. He swings the baseball bat with massive force, connecting with @Element4 the zombie's head. The impact sends gore and debris flying. The zombie's head is crushed by the blow. The body crumples and falls to the desert road. The jeep continues forward without stopping. Brutal, visceral impact. Cinematic action.
