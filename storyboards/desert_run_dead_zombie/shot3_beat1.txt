GROUND LEVEL SHOT. Camera sits on the hot desert road. In the foreground, @Element4 the headless zombie body lies crumpled on the asphalt, tattered rags, dark stain spreading. Beyond it, the military jeep drives away down the long straight highway, trailing a plume of dust, shrinking into the distance. The harsh sun beats down. Heat haze shimmers. Total desolation. The jeep disappears toward the horizon. Stillness returns to the wasteland.
