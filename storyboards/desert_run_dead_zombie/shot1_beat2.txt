SAME ANGLE BEHIND THE JEEP. The jeep is now much closer to @Element4 the zombie on the right shoulder. @Element3 the gorilla rises in the back, gripping the baseball bat, readying himself. @Element1 the driver steers the jeep slightly toward the right shoulder. @Element2 the robot turns its CRT head to watch. Tension builds as they close in on the zombie.
