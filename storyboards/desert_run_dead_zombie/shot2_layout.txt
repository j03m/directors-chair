Over-the-shoulder shot from behind the gorilla (large figure) who is in the rear of a moving jeep. The gorilla is in the foreground left, arm extended swinging a bat. A regular_male figure (zombie) is directly in front of the gorilla at arm's length on the right side, at head height. Camera is tight behind the gorilla's right shoulder looking past the bat toward the zombie's head. Extreme action shot. Camera lens ~24mm for dramatic perspective.
