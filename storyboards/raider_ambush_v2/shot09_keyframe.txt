Use @Image1 as composition reference. Over the shoulder, cliff edge, action.

Over @Element1 a massive gorilla in viking armor and horned helmet's shoulder — he lies FLAT on his belly at the cliff edge, completely prone, stomach pressed to the rock. He grips a McMillan TAC-338 sniper rifle with a scope, stretched out along the ground. A bright muzzle flash erupts from the barrel. The recoil kicks his massive shoulder. Dust and debris blow up from the cliff edge around the barrel. The winding desert road is visible far below in the distance. His furry gorilla arms stretch forward along the rifle stock.

Prone sniper position, muzzle flash, dust, recoil. Cliff edge, desert road below. Photorealistic, cinematic.
