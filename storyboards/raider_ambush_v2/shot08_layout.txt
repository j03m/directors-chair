Through a circular sniper scope vignette. A desert road beside a stopped cab-over box truck. Four figures kneel in a row on the road with hands behind their heads. A standing figure leans menacingly toward the first kneeling figure. A second standing figure guards behind the row with a rifle. The crosshair is centered on the leaning standing figure's head. Black vignette edges.
