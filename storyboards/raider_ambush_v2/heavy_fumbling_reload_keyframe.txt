Use @Image1 as composition reference. Medium shot, desert road, behind the cab-over box truck.

@Element1 a heavyset raider with a beer gut, executioner hood, and leather vest crouches behind the cab-over box truck. He is alone — the last raider standing. He fumbles with his AK-47, struggling to reload it, thick fingers clumsy with the magazine. He is out of breath, chest heaving, sweat visible on his exposed arms. His body language is panicked and exhausted. The fallen body of the goggles raider slumps nearby against the truck. The cab-over box truck provides cover from the cliff above.

Desert road, dust, harsh light. Cab-over truck. Photorealistic, cinematic. The last raider — winded, fumbling, running out of time.
