Use @Image1 as composition reference. Medium shot, desert road, behind the cab-over box truck.

@Element1 a raider in motorcycle goggles and a spiked leather jacket leans out from behind the cab-over box truck, AK-47 raised, trying to return fire toward the cliff — but he is hit by a sniper round in the torso. Red mist erupts from his chest. The impact sends him staggering backward, his AK-47 flying out of his hands and tumbling onto the road. His body twists from the hit, goggles askew on his face. The cab-over box truck is right behind him — he was using it as cover but leaned out too far.

Desert road, dust, red mist, the AK-47 skidding across the road. Harsh light, cab-over box truck. Photorealistic, cinematic. The moment of impact — goggles caught in the open.
