Use @Image1 as composition reference. Through a circular sniper scope vignette, black around the edges.

View through a rifle scope. The crosshair is centered directly on the head of @Element1 a raider in a cracked hockey mask with makeshift sheet metal armor. He stands tall, oblivious, looking down at hostages at his feet. The crosshair sits right on his hockey mask. He has no idea what's about to happen.

Through the scope, desert road. Harsh light. Photorealistic, cinematic. The moment before the trigger pull. Sniper POV.
