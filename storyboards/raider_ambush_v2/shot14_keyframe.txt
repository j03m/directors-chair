Side view of @Element1 a rugged bearded warrior in a tactical vest lying prone at the cliff edge. He looks through a rifle scope, finger on the trigger. A bright muzzle flash erupts from the barrel to the right. Recoil rocks his shoulder. Dust and small rocks scatter from the concussion. His face is set, focused, professional.

Side profile, cliff edge. Muzzle flash, dust, recoil. Photorealistic, cinematic. Different angle from previous firing shots.
