Side view of @Element1 a rugged man with a thick dark beard and heavy stubble, wearing an open tactical combat vest over bare muscular arms. He lies prone at the cliff edge, looking through a McMillan TAC-338 sniper rifle scope. His bearded face is set, focused, professional. A bright muzzle flash erupts from the barrel to the right. Recoil rocks his shoulder. Dust and small rocks scatter from the concussion. Desert combat pants, heavy boots. His beard is prominent in the side profile.
