The gorilla's weapon is wrong — it should be a McMillan TAC-338 bolt-action sniper rifle, NOT a machine gun or assault rifle. A long, heavy-barreled precision sniper rifle with a scope mounted on top. Keep everything else exactly the same — the gorilla in viking armor, prone at cliff edge, muzzle flash, low angle, sky.
