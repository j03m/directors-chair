Use @Image1 as composition reference. A wide-angle, high-angle cinematic establishing shot of a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland. A flat, straight asphalt road runs horizontally across the entire frame (East-West direction). The camera is approximately 400 meters from the road, elevated at a slight angle. Cinematic 2.35:1 aspect ratio with black letterbox bars. Desaturated color palette: sandy tans, dusty greys, and rusted iron.

On the far left, a group of four wasteland raiders stand behind a makeshift roadblock made of stacked old tires and rusted scrap metal, with four motorcycles parked nearby: @Element1 a raider in a cracked hockey mask with sheet metal armor, @Element2 a raider in motorcycle goggles and a spiked leather jacket, @Element3 a young skinny raider in a grey t-shirt, and @Element4 a heavyset raider with a beer gut and executioner hood. All four hold AK-47 rifles pointed straight up at the sky — celebratory warning shots aimed upward, not aimed at the truck.

In the center-right, approximately 200 meters of empty road away from the roadblock, a weathered dusty tan cab-over box truck is driving along the road toward the roadblock, slowing down. @Element5 a lean woman with blonde war hawk hair is visible driving the cab-over box truck.

The landscape is a vast, barren desert under a harsh, hazy midday sun. Extreme long shot — the figures are small in the frame. Photorealistic, cinematic.
