A sniper round hits the greasy raider in the neck. Red mist and blood spray erupts from the impact. THEN he grabs his throat with both hands, eyes wide in shock. Blood runs between his fingers. He stumbles sideways and collapses to the ground. His AK-47 clatters on the road. The shot comes first, then the reaction.
