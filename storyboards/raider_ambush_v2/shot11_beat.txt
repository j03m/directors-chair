Over the gorilla's shoulder from the cliff. Far below, CHAOS — people scatter in every direction in frantic panic, running wildly for cover. Total pandemonium. The gorilla does NOT shoot, no muzzle flash, no gunfire. He just watches. The truck is COMPLETELY STATIONARY, does not move at all. Only the people move.
