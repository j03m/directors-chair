SINGLE CONTINUOUS SHOT, NO CUTS. A raider in goggles and spiked leather stands upright next to a STATIONARY parked truck that DOES NOT MOVE. He is hit by a bullet — the impact is violent and sudden, his body jerks backwards, he is knocked clean off his feet and flies atleast a foot backwards landing onto his back on the ground. Red mist erupts from the impact. His AK-47 drops. He lands flat on his back, dead. The truck stays perfectly still the entire time, engine off, parked. Only the man moves.
