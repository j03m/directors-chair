Medium shot from behind: a young skinny raider in a grey t-shirt with an AK-47 slung over his shoulder lights a cigarette on the desert road, cupping his hands around the flame. He takes a slow drag, exhales smoke, and glances lazily over his shoulder toward the distant truck and figures on the road. Completely relaxed, unaware of the danger above. Wind stirs dust around his boots.
