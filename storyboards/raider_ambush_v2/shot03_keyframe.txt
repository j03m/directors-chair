Use @Image1 as composition reference. Medium-wide shot on a desert road beside a stopped cab-over box truck. Desaturated color palette: sandy tans, dusty greys, rusted iron.

Four figures kneel in a row on the road with their hands behind their heads: @Element2 a lean woman with blonde war hawk hair, sleeve tattoos, canvas tank top, and cargo pants kneels at the end of the row nearest camera — she stares up with a fierce, defiant expression. Beside her: @Element4 a civilian man in a denim jacket and baseball cap, @Element5 a civilian man in a mechanic jumpsuit, and @Element6 a civilian man in a military field jacket and keffiyeh scarf — all three kneel with hands behind their heads, looking down.

@Element1 a raider in a cracked hockey mask with sheet metal armor stands directly in front of the kneeling woman, pointing at her aggressively with one hand. His other hand holds an AK-47 rifle at his side, pointed down at the ground.

Behind the row of kneeling captives, @Element3 a raider in motorcycle goggles and a spiked leather jacket stands guard with an AK-47 rifle.

A white cab-over box truck with light weathering is visible in the background. Desert road, dust, harsh light. Photorealistic, cinematic.
