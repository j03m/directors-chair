Use @Image1 as composition reference. Medium shot, desert road, aftermath.

@Element1 a heavyset raider with a massive beer gut, wearing an executioner hood and leather vest, lies dead on the ground in front of the front of a cab-over box truck. He is flat on his back, arms splayed out, completely motionless and lifeless. Red wounds visible on his chest. His AK-47 lies on the ground nearby. Dust settled around him.

Desert road. A large photorealistic white cab-over box truck with light weathering parked on the road — real metal, real paint, real tires. The dead raider is on the ground in front of the truck's cab. Harsh light. Photorealistic, cinematic.
