Use @Image1 as composition reference. Medium shot, desert road, impact.

@Element1 a heavyset raider with a massive beer gut, wearing an executioner hood and leather vest, is knocked forcefully off his feet by an impact to his torso. His heavy body flies backwards, thick arms flung wide. His axe spins away through the air. Red mist erupts around his chest. His boots leave the ground. The open desert road stretches behind him. Dust billows from the impact.

Desert road, dust, red mist. Harsh light. Photorealistic, cinematic. Only the raider in frame, open desert behind him.
