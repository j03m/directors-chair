Extreme wide bird's eye establishing shot from very very high up, as if the camera is on a tall cliff hundreds of feet above, looking almost straight down at a desert road far below. The road runs across the scene left to right. Everything should be very tiny and distant.

Camera should be extremely high — at least 200 units above the ground, looking down at a steep angle.

On the far left side of the road, a small cluster of objects represents a barricade — small cubes and cylinders for tires and debris. 4 tiny motorcycles and 4 tiny figures stand near the barricade.

On the far right side, very far from the barricade — at least 3x the width of the barricade cluster away — a single large box represents a cab-over box truck. There must be a huge gap of empty road between the barricade group and the truck. The truck should be at least 40-50 units away from the barricade along the road.
