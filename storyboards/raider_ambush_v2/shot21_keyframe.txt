Use @Image1 as composition reference. Low angle, ground level, in front of the cab-over box truck.

@Element1 a lean woman with blonde war hawk hair and sleeve tattoos is on the ground in front of the cab-over box truck, flat on her stomach. She is pushing herself up slightly, looking up and to the side — she has spotted something on the road. Her eyes are sharp, calculating, narrowing with recognition. Dust and grit on her face and hair. Her hands are empty — no weapon. The cab-over box truck looms behind her. She's about to make a move.

Ground level, dust, harsh light. Cab-over truck behind her. Photorealistic, cinematic. The moment she spots the fallen AK-47.
