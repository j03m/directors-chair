Use @Image1 as composition reference. Extreme close-up, face level.

@Element1 a massive gorilla in a viking horned helmet, extreme close-up on his face. One eye pressed against the scope eyepiece of a McMillan TAC-338 sniper rifle. The other eye squinted shut. His mouth is slightly open, about to mouth the word "boom." Intense concentration. The metal of the McMillan TAC-338 scope and rifle visible beside his face.

Golden hour light on his fur and helmet. Photorealistic, cinematic. Deadly focus.
