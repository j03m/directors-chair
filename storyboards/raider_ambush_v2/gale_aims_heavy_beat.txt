Over a woman's shoulder as she unloads an AK-47 across the road at a heavyset raider near the cab-over box truck. Continuous muzzle flash. Shell casings fly. The bullets knock the heavyset raider backwards — he staggers from each impact, red mist erupting from his body. The final burst sends him flying backwards off his feet. He crashes to the ground dead, flat on his back, arms splayed. She braces against the recoil, relentless.
