Use @Image1 as composition reference. Medium shot from behind the rear of a white cab-over box truck with light weathering, photorealistic, real metal, real paint, real tires. Desaturated color palette: sandy tans, dusty greys, rusted iron.

@Element1 a heavyset raider with a beer gut, wearing an executioner hood, leather vest, and heavy boots stands vigilantly behind the truck on the left side of the frame, partially concealed by the truck body. He grips an AK-47 in one hand, watching and waiting. His posture is tense, coiled.

To the right of the truck, visible past the truck's edge further down the desert road, the roadblock scene unfolds in the distance. The scene should be the reference from @Anchor viewed from behind the hostages.

Desert road, harsh light, heat shimmer. Photorealistic, cinematic.
