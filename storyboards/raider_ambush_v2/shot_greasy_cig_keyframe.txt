Use @Image1 as composition reference. Medium shot from behind and to the side. Desaturated color palette: sandy tans, dusty greys, rusted iron.

@Element1 a young skinny sickly raider in an oversized grey t-shirt and cargo pants stands in the right foreground of the frame, turned partially away from camera. An AK-47 rifle hangs loosely from a strap over his shoulder. He is lighting a cigarette, cupping his hands around a lighter, greasy hair hanging in his face. He looks relaxed, unconcerned.

Over his shoulder in the far distance down the desert road, a white cab-over box truck is stopped. Tiny figures are visible near the truck — the roadblock scene unfolding far away. The distance makes it clear greasy is positioned further down the road, separate from the main group.

Desert road, harsh light, heat shimmer. Photorealistic, cinematic.
