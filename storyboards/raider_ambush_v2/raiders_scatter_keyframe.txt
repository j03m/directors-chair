Use @Image1 as composition reference. Wide shot, desert road, chaos.

Desert road in chaos. @Element1 a raider in motorcycle goggles and spiked leather jacket clutches an AK-47 assault rifle, ducking behind the cab-over box truck for cover. He peers out from behind the truck, firing blindly up toward the cliff. @Element2 a heavyset raider with a beer gut and executioner hood crouches behind the other side of the truck, AK-47 raised, trying to return fire toward the cliff above. Both raiders are panicked, pinned down behind the cab-over box truck, using it as cover from the sniper fire raining down from the cliff.

Dust, chaos, muzzle flashes. Desert road, harsh light, cab-over box truck as cover. Photorealistic, cinematic. Raiders pinned down and returning fire.
