The slumped raider in the background (goggles raider) should more closely match his character — motorcycle goggles, spiked leather jacket. He should have a visible red wound on his chest showing where he was shot. Keep everything else exactly the same — the heavy raider in front, his AK-47, the truck, road, desert.
