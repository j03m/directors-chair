High-angle shot looking down at a desert road. A cab-over box truck is stopped on the road. In front of the truck, four figures kneel in a row on the ground with hands behind their heads — one female and three males. Two armed figures stand behind the kneeling group, facing them with weapons raised. Camera is elevated about 30 degrees, close enough to see faces.
