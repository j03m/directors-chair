Use @Image1 as composition reference. Extreme close-up on a face, panic.

@Element1 extreme close-up of a young skinny raider with greasy hair and an oversized grey t-shirt. His eyes are wide with terror. His mouth is open, screaming. He looks to the side and up — realizing what just happened, where the threat is coming from. Sweat and grime on his face. Pure panic.

Tight close-up filling the frame. Harsh desert light. Photorealistic, cinematic. The moment of realization.
