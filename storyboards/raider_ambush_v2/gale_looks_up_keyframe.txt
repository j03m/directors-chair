Use @Image1 as composition reference. Mid shot, upper torso and face.

@Element1 a lean woman with blonde war hawk hair and sleeve tattoos on both arms. Mid shot framing her from the chest up. She shields her eyes with one hand and looks UP, scanning the cliffs above, searching for where the shots came from. Expression of confusion, awe, relief. Wind blows dust across her face. Desaturated color palette.

No truck, no other characters. Just her against open desert sky. Harsh light. Photorealistic, cinematic. Aftermath, moment of wonder — who just saved them?
