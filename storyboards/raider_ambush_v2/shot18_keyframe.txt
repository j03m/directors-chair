An AK-47 assault rifle tumbles through the air and clatters onto the dusty desert road. The rifle skids across the dirt, kicking up a small cloud of dust. In the blurred background, the cab-over box truck and the slumped body of a fallen raider are visible. The rifle comes to rest on the road — abandoned, available.

Close-up of the AK-47 on the desert road. Dust settling. Harsh sunlight glinting off the metal. Photorealistic, cinematic. The gun that will change the fight.
