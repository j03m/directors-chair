Medium shot from behind the truck: a heavyset raider with a beer gut, wearing an executioner hood, leather vest, and heavy boots stands vigilantly behind the truck on the left side of the frame, partially concealed by the truck body. He grips an AK-47 in one hand, watching and waiting. His posture is tense, coiled. He shifts his weight, adjusting his grip on the axe, waiting for his moment. Dust drifts in the harsh desert light.
