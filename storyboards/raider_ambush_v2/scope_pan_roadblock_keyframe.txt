Use @Image1 as composition reference. Through a circular sniper scope vignette, black around the edges.

View through a rifle scope from a cliff that runs parallel to the desert road below. On the left side of the scope, @Element1 a raider in a hockey mask with sheet metal armor, @Element2 a raider in motorcycle goggles and spiked leather jacket, @Element3 a young skinny raider in a grey t-shirt, and @Element4 a heavyset raider with a beer gut and executioner hood walk along the road toward a stopped cab-over style truck in the distance. They fire AK-47 style weapons into the air — muzzle flashes and smoke. Behind them, a makeshift roadblock of motorcycles, tires, and scrap metal debris. On the right side, @Element5 a lean woman with blonde war hawk hair and sleeve tattoos steps out of the driver's side door of the cab-over box truck, hands raised in surrender. The crosshair tracks the approaching raiders. Black vignette edges — classic sniper scope POV.

Desaturated color palette: sandy tans, dusty greys, rusted iron. Desert road, harsh light, heat shimmer. Photorealistic, cinematic. Sniper surveillance of the approaching threat.
