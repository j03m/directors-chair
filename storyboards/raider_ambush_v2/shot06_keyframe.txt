Use @Image1 as composition reference. View through a circular sniper rifle scope — black vignette border framing a circular view.

Through the scope from the cliff above: a dusty desert road beside a stopped civilian cab-over box truck. @Element1 a woman with blonde war hawk hair and sleeve tattoos stands near the truck with a raider's weapon pointed at her. @Element2 a civilian man in a denim jacket kneels beside the truck with hands behind his head. @Element3 a civilian in a mechanic jumpsuit kneels nearby with hands behind his head. @Element4 a civilian in a military field jacket and keffiyeh kneels at the end of the row with hands behind his head. Raiders stand guard over them. The crosshair scans the hostage scene.

Harsh daylight, dust. Hostages on their knees, hands behind heads. Photorealistic, cinematic. Circular scope reticle frames the image. No tactical suit soldiers — only desert raiders and civilian hostages.
