Medium-wide shot on a desert road beside a cab-over box truck. Four figures kneel in a row on the road with hands behind their heads — one female at the near end, three males beside her. A standing figure faces the kneeling female, holding a blade under her chin. A second standing figure paces behind the row of kneeling hostages with a rifle. Camera is slightly elevated, not too far, medium-wide framing.
