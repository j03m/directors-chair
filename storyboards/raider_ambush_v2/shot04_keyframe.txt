@Element1 extreme close-up of a raider's face through a cracked, filthy hockey mask. His eyes are visible through the mask openings — cruel, cold, enjoying this. The mask is battered, scratched, stained. Sweat and grime on the skin visible around the edges. He breathes heavily.

Tight close-up filling the frame. Harsh desert light. Photorealistic, cinematic. Villain portrait.
