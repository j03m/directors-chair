Use @Image1 as composition reference. Through a circular sniper scope vignette, black around the edges.

View through a rifle scope. The circular scope view shows a desert road. A beaten-up motorcycle and scrap metal debris form a makeshift roadblock. The crosshair is centered on the roadblock. Beyond the roadblock, a truck is stopped in the distance with small figures around it. The edges of the frame are black — classic sniper scope POV.

Desert road, harsh light, heat shimmer. Photorealistic, cinematic. Sniper surveillance.
