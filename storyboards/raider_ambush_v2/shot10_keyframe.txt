Use @Image1 as composition reference. Ground level, desert road, chaotic action.

@Element1 a raider in a cracked hockey mask and sheet metal armor stands on the left — he is hit by a sniper round from above. Red mist erupts around his head. He is mid-fall, body going limp, knees buckling. His pipe weapon drops from his hand. @Element2 a lean woman with blonde war hawk hair and sleeve tattoos is flat on the desert road to the right, arms over her head, pressing herself into the dirt. A man in a denim jacket lies face-down beside her.

Chaos — dust, red mist, the moment of impact. Desert road, harsh sunlight. Photorealistic, cinematic, intense action scene. No mannequins, no block figures, only photorealistic humans.
