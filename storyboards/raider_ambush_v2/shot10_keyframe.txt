Use @Image1 as composition reference. Medium-wide shot on a desert road beside a stopped cab-over box truck. Desaturated color palette: sandy tans, dusty greys, rusted iron. Chaotic action moment.

@Element1 a raider in a cracked white hockey mask with sheet metal armor stands in the center — a sniper round has just hit him in the head. Red mist erupts from the impact. His body is going limp, knees buckling, mid-fall. His AK-47 drops from his hand.

Around him, the hostage lineup is scattering in panic: @Element2 a lean woman with blonde war hawk hair and sleeve tattoos throws herself flat on the ground, arms over her head. @Element4 a civilian man in a denim jacket, @Element5 a civilian man in a mechanic jumpsuit, and @Element6 a civilian man in a military field jacket and keffiyeh — all three diving to the ground, hitting the deck, arms covering their heads.

@Element3 a raider in motorcycle goggles and spiked leather jacket scrambles frantically toward the cab-over box truck for cover, running away from the falling hockey mask raider.

The cab-over box truck is in the background. Desert road, dust, red mist, harsh sunlight. Photorealistic, cinematic. The moment of impact — pure chaos.
