Use @Image1 as composition reference. Medium shot, desert road, aftermath.

@Element1 a lean woman with blonde war hawk hair and sleeve tattoos on both arms stands on the road, machine gun hanging at her side. She shields her eyes with one hand and looks UP at a distant cliff above. Squinting against the sun. Who just saved them? @Element2 a civilian man is getting up from the ground behind her, dusting himself off.

Dust settling. The truck nearby. Desert road, harsh light. Photorealistic, cinematic. Aftermath, moment of wonder.
