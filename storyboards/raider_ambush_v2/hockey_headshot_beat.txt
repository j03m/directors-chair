CRACK — a sniper bullet hits the hockey-masked raider in the head. His head explodes in a spray of blood. His body crumples and falls. The kneeling captives throw themselves flat on the ground, arms over their heads. The other raiders scramble frantically, diving behind the truck and motorcycles for cover. Dust and blood in the air. Pure chaos.
