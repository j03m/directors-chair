Rotate the heavy raider so he is facing the OTHER direction — his head should be toward the truck, feet pointing away. He should have red wounds visible on his chest showing where he was shot. The cab-over box truck should have a bit more rust and weathering — not pristine but not falling apart either. Keep everything else exactly the same — desert road, harsh light.
