Over-the-shoulder shot from behind a large figure (gorilla) who is standing in the back of a moving vehicle. The gorilla fills the left side of frame, arm extended holding a long bat-like object in a swinging arc. A regular_male figure (zombie) stands at arm's length on the right side of frame at the same height, directly in the path of the swing. Camera tight behind the gorilla's right shoulder, looking past the bat toward the zombie. Action shot, camera lens ~24mm wide for dramatic perspective. Desert road background.
