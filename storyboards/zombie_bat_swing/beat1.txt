OVER-THE-SHOULDER from behind @Element1 the gorilla. The jeep roars past the zombie. The gorilla swings the baseball bat with massive force. The bat connects with @Element2 the zombie's head in a brutal mailbox-baseball hit. The impact is devastating. The zombie's body crumples and ragdolls as the jeep speeds past without slowing down. Dust and debris. One swing, one kill. The jeep continues down the highway.
