Use @Image1 as composition reference. Over-the-shoulder action shot from behind @Element1 a massive gorilla in viking armor with horned helmet, standing in the cargo bed of a speeding military jeep. The gorilla swings a baseball bat in a powerful lateral arc toward @Element2 a shambling zombie on the road shoulder. The zombie faces the camera — grey sun-blackened skin, cloudy dead eyes, jaw agape, tattered rags. The bat is mid-swing about to connect with the zombie's head. Classic mailbox baseball from a moving vehicle. Motion blur on the bat. Desert highway, harsh sun, dust kicked up from the jeep. Photorealistic, cinematic, brutal, Mad Max Fury Road.
