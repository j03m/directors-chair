Camera behind and slightly above a military jeep shape on a desert highway. A large figure (gorilla) stands in the rear cargo bed holding a long bat-like object. Two smaller figures sit in the front seats. Far ahead on the right shoulder of the road, a single regular_male figure (zombie) shambles along, small in frame. The jeep is center-left, the zombie is distant on the right. Camera lens ~35mm, looking forward past the jeep toward the zombie.
