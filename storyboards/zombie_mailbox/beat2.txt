The jeep roars up alongside @Element2 the zombie on the right shoulder. @Element1 the gorilla swings the baseball bat in a massive lateral arc, mailbox-baseball style from the moving jeep. The bat connects with the zombie. The impact is brutal and fast. The zombie crumples and falls to the road as the jeep blows past without slowing down. Dust and debris fly.
