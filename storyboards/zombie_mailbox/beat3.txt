The jeep accelerates away down the long straight desert highway, leaving @Element2 the zombie's fallen body crumpled on the road behind. @Element1 the gorilla sits back down in the cargo bed, bat resting on his shoulder. The jeep trails dust as it shrinks into the distance. Heat shimmer on the road. The wasteland returns to silence.
