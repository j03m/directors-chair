Use @Image1 as composition reference. Camera behind and slightly above a classic open-top military jeep, olive drab, rusted, no roof, roll bars. The jeep barrels down a cracked desert highway. @Element1 a massive gorilla in viking armor stands in the rear cargo bed gripping a baseball bat, seen from behind. Two figures sit in the front seats — a rugged bearded warrior driving and a rusty robot with a CRT screen head riding shotgun. All face forward, away from camera. Far ahead on the right shoulder, @Element2 a shambling zombie in bleached tattered rags walks along the roadside, small in frame, oblivious. Harsh midday sun, cracked asphalt, dust haze, vast empty desert. Photorealistic, cinematic, Mad Max Fury Road.
