GROUND LEVEL SHOT on the hot desert road. @Element1 the zombie's body lies crumpled and motionless on the asphalt, tattered rags, face-down on the blacktop. Beyond it, the military jeep drives away down the long straight highway, trailing dust, shrinking into the distance. The harsh sun beats down. Heat shimmer rises off the road. Total stillness. The jeep disappears toward the horizon. Desolation. The wasteland reclaims its silence.
