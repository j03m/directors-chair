Camera at ground level on a desert highway. A regular_male figure (zombie) lies crumpled and fallen on the cracked asphalt in the foreground, taking up the bottom third of frame. Beyond the body, the road stretches straight to a vanishing point. A small vehicle shape is distant on the highway, driving away. Camera lens ~24mm wide angle, ground level, looking past the fallen body down the empty road.
