Use @Image1 as composition reference. Ground-level camera on cracked desert asphalt. In the near foreground, @Element1 the zombie lies fallen and motionless on the road — crumpled body in tattered rags, sprawled face-down across the road shoulder. Beyond the body, a classic military jeep drives away down the long straight desert highway, trailing a plume of dust, shrinking into the distance. The road stretches to the vanishing point under brutal midday sun. Empty wasteland on both sides. Photorealistic, cinematic, bleak aftermath, Cormac McCarthy desolation.
