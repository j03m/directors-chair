Use @Image1 as composition reference. View through a circular sniper rifle scope — black vignette border framing a circular view of the scene below.

Through the scope: a dusty desert road. A beaten-up truck is stopped. Two motorcycles block the road in front of it. @Element1 a raider in a hockey mask with makeshift armor stands near the truck door aiming a machine gun. @Element2 a raider in motorcycle goggles and spiked leather jacket aims a weapon at the truck. @Element3 a skinny young raider in an oversized grey t-shirt holds a crude weapon. @Element4 a heavyset raider with an executioner hood stands nearby with an axe.

The raiders are surrounding the truck aggressively. Desert road, harsh daylight. Photorealistic, cinematic. The circular scope reticle overlay frames the entire image.
