Wide establishing shot of an empty desert highway stretching to the horizon.
Camera is low, near road level, looking down the long straight road into the distance.
No characters in this shot — just the empty road and vast desert landscape.
A single small cube far in the distance on the road to suggest something approaching.
Flat desert ground on both sides of the road. Camera lens ~35mm.
The road can be a long thin dark rectangle on the ground plane.
