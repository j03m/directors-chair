Use @Image1 as composition reference. Three-quarter front tracking shot of a classic open-top military jeep, no roof, flat folded windshield, roll bars, olive drab paint faded and rusted. Camera ahead and to the left at 45 degrees, we see the front grille and into the open cabin.
Desert highway, harsh midday sun, dust trailing behind. Photorealistic, cinematic, Mad Max Fury Road.


@Element1 a rugged bearded post-apocalyptic warrior drives, hands on the wheel. 

@Element2 a rusty robot is sitting next to @Element1 in the passenger seat. 

@Element3 a massive warrior gorilla is crouched in the reach cargo bed holding onto the jeeps roll bar. He has a baseball bat held casually.
