Use @Image1 as composition reference. Wide cinematic establishing shot of an empty post-apocalyptic desert highway stretching into the infinite horizon. Cracked asphalt, sun-bleached road markings. Vast barren wasteland on both sides — sand, scrub, distant mesas. Harsh midday sun overhead, heat haze shimmering off the road. A tiny dust cloud barely visible in the far distance. Photorealistic, cinematic, Mad Max Fury Road, desolate, empty, lonely road to nowhere.
