Three-quarter front tracking shot of a classic open-top military jeep driving toward and past camera. Camera positioned ahead and to the left at a 45-degree angle, slightly below windshield level, tracking with the vehicle. We see the front grille, driver side, and into the open cabin. Inside the jeep: driver (regular_male, cranial) in the left seat with hands on steering wheel, passenger (regular_male, robot) in the right seat, and a large figure (gorilla) hulking in the rear cargo area. The jeep is a simple rectangular body with no roof, a flat windshield, visible roll bars. Desert road beneath, blurred background suggesting motion. Camera lens ~35mm.
