THREE-QUARTER FRONT TRACKING SHOT of a classic open-top military jeep on a desert highway. Camera dollies ahead and to the side at 45 degrees. @Element1 the rugged warrior drives steadily, eyes on the road. @Element2 the CRT-headed robot sits in the passenger seat, screen flickering. @Element3 the massive gorilla warrior sits in the back gripping a baseball bat. Wind whips past. Dust trail behind. Steady driving, scanning the wasteland.
