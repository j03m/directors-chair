He tenses, snaps his fingers and points forward urgently. @Element2 the robot turns its CRT head to look. The CRT screen flickers with a blinking stick figure zombie. @Element3 the gorilla in the back perks up, grips the baseball bat tighter, leaning forward with anticipation. The jeep continues rolling down the highway.
