A professional character design reference of a skinny, starved-looking post-apocalyptic raider standing with unhinged energy.

Set in a gritty, Mad Max / Fallout style post-apocalyptic desert world. Photorealistic, cinematic quality.

Physical Details:
- Ethnicity: Caucasian with Eastern European features. Slavic bone structure. Sunken cheeks, hollow eyes.
- Face: Visible — no mask. Greasy, stringy hair hanging past his ears, dirty blonde or light brown. A patchy beard that refuses to grow in fully — sparse, wispy, gross. Wild eyes with dark circles. Missing a tooth or two.
- Build: Skinny, borderline emaciated. Ribs visible. Wiry and twitchy. Looks like he hasn't eaten properly in weeks.
- He looks like an unhinged homeless person. The most feral and desperate of the group.

Costume Details:
- Head: No mask, no hat. Just greasy unwashed hair.
- Torso: Shirtless. Bare skinny chest and visible ribs, smeared with dirt and soot. A few crude stick-and-poke tattoos — prison style. Sunburned shoulders peeling.
- Arms: Bare, thin, sinewy. Veins visible. Dirty hands with black fingernails.
- Belt: A piece of electrical cord used as a belt.
- Legs: Oversized military surplus cargo pants, way too big for him, cinched with the cord belt. Sagging and filthy. Multiple pockets bulging with scavenged junk.
- Feet: Old sneakers falling apart, one sole flapping loose. No socks visible.
- Weapon: A sharpened piece of rebar or a crude shiv. Something desperate and improvised.

Minimal armor — almost none. He is the scrappiest, most desperate member of the gang. Covered in dust, grease, and grime. He looks starved, twitchy, and dangerous.

The image shows the full body, standing, facing the camera. Harsh desert sunlight. Background is flat neutral sand. 8k resolution, cinematic.
