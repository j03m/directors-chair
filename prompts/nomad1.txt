A professional character design reference of a Caucasian male post-apocalyptic civilian standing upright.

Set in a gritty, Mad Max / Fallout style post-apocalyptic desert world. Photorealistic, cinematic quality.

Physical Details:
- Ethnicity: Caucasian. Pale skin sunburned red and peeling.
- Face: Scruffy, tired. Short messy hair. A few days of stubble. Not menacing — just exhausted and wary.
- Build: Average, slightly underfed.

Costume Details:
- Head: A beat-up baseball cap or nothing. No headscarf, no hood.
- Torso: A repurposed denim jacket with the sleeves torn off, worn over a faded and stained t-shirt. The jacket has crude patches sewn on with mismatched thread.
- Hands: Makeshift fingerless gloves made from cut-up work gloves. Dirty.
- Belt: A repurposed leather belt with a dented canteen clipped on.
- Legs: Worn-out cargo pants, one leg torn at the knee. Duct tape patch on one thigh.
- Feet: Scuffed work boots, laces replaced with wire.

He is covered in dust and grime. Everything he wears was found or repurposed. He is a civilian, not a fighter — just someone surviving day to day in the wasteland.

The image shows the full body, standing, facing the camera. Harsh desert sunlight. Background is flat neutral sand. 8k resolution, cinematic.
