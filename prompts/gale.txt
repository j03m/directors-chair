A professional character design reference of a lean, beautiful woman standing upright with confident posture.

Set in a gritty, Mad Max / Fallout style post-apocalyptic desert world. Photorealistic, cinematic quality.

Physical Details:
- Build: Lean and athletic, toned arms from physical work. Not bulky — wiry strong.
- Face: Striking, beautiful features with sharp cheekbones. Intense eyes. Sun-kissed skin with dust and grease smudges.
- Hair: Blonde war hawk hairstyle — shaved sides, long blonde mohawk swept back or to one side. Messy and windblown.
- Arms: Full sleeve tattoos on BOTH arms — intricate black ink designs visible from shoulder to wrist. Tribal, geometric, and organic patterns mixed together.

Costume Details:
- Torso: A fitted canvas tank top — the kind a mechanic wears — faded olive or tan, stained with grease and motor oil. The tank top reveals her tattooed shoulders and arms but does NOT show midriff — it is tucked in. Over it, a few pieces of makeshift armor — a hammered metal shoulder guard on one side, strapped on with leather.
- Hands: Heavy mechanic's work gloves, stained with grease. One glove tucked into her belt.
- Belt: A heavy leather tool belt with wrenches, pliers, a rag hanging from it. A knife sheath on one hip.
- Legs: Sturdy canvas cargo pants — practical, workwear style. Dusty and grease-stained but intact. Not tight, not flowing — utilitarian.
- Feet: Heavy lace-up work boots, steel-toed, scuffed and dusty.
- Accessories: A pair of welding goggles pushed up on her forehead. A leather cord necklace.

She is an engine monkey — a mechanic and fighter. Her clothing is practical workwear, not fashion. She looks like she just crawled out from under a truck and could kick your ass. Tough, capable, beautiful, but dressed for work and combat.

The image shows the full body, standing, facing the camera. Harsh desert sunlight. Background is flat neutral sand. 8k resolution, cinematic.
