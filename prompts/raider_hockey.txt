A professional character design reference of a menacing post-apocalyptic raider standing in an aggressive stance.

Set in a gritty, Mad Max / Fallout style post-apocalyptic desert world. Photorealistic, cinematic quality.

Physical Details:
- Ethnicity: Caucasian with Eastern European features. Slavic bone structure, pale skin under layers of filth.
- Build: Medium, tough. Not bodybuilder — more like someone who fights dirty to survive.
- He looks like a violent homeless person. Grimy, unwashed, feral.

Costume Details:
- Head: A dirty white hockey mask, cracked and yellowed with age, strapped to his face with mismatched leather straps and bungee cord. Scratches and dents across the surface.
- Torso: Makeshift armor — pieces of sheet metal and car parts bolted and wired onto a filthy denim vest. A bent license plate wired to one shoulder as a pauldron. Underneath, a stained and torn long-sleeve thermal shirt.
- Arms: Wrapped in dirty athletic tape and strips of rubber tire. One forearm has a crude metal bracer made from a flattened tin can.
- Hands: Bare, filthy, cracked knuckles.
- Legs: Torn dark jeans held together with duct tape and safety pins. One knee has a hubcap wired on as a knee guard.
- Feet: Heavy mismatched boots — one combat boot, one work boot. Both caked in mud and dust.
- Weapon: A metal pipe or rebar club, wrapped in tape at the grip.

Covered head to toe in dust, grime, and dried mud. Everything is scavenged junk repurposed as armor. He is terrifying but clearly destitute.
