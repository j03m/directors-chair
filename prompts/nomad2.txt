A professional character design reference of an East Asian male post-apocalyptic civilian standing upright.

Set in a gritty, Mad Max / Fallout style post-apocalyptic desert world. Photorealistic, cinematic quality.

Physical Details:
- Ethnicity: East Asian. Dark hair buzzed short. Tan skin weathered by sun.
- Face: Young, mid-20s. Quiet, cautious expression. Clean-shaven or barely visible stubble.
- Build: Slim, wiry.

Costume Details:
- Head: A pair of cracked safety goggles pushed up on his forehead. No hat.
- Torso: A faded mechanic's jumpsuit with the top half unzipped and tied around his waist, revealing a grimy thermal undershirt underneath. Sleeves rolled up.
- Hands: Worn leather work gloves, cracked and sun-bleached.
- Belt: A nylon tool belt repurposed as a utility belt, holding a wrench and a water bottle.
- Legs: The bottom half of the mechanic's jumpsuit, stained with grease and dust. One knee patched with canvas.
- Feet: Old hiking boots, soles worn smooth.

He is covered in dust and grime. Everything he wears was found or repurposed from pre-war junk. He is a civilian, not a fighter — quiet and careful.

The image shows the full body, standing, facing the camera. Harsh desert sunlight. Background is flat neutral sand. 8k resolution, cinematic.
